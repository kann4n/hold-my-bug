# Hold My BugðŸª²

A perfectly useless VS Code extension that randomly inserts emojis, typos, and sarcastic comments into your code, providing the ultimate distraction for developers who are tired of productive coding.

## Features

Hold My Bug is more than a simple extension; it's a commitment to chaos. Itâ€™s designed to challenge your focus and inject an element of fun into the monotonous task of debugging.

### Core Commands

You can activate the extension's chaos using the VS Code Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`).

  * `Hold My Bug: Start Inserting Emojis`: Activates the regular mode, which inserts emojis on a timer and after a certain number of characters are typed.
  * `Hold My Bug: Extreme Mode`: For a truly chaotic experience, this command drastically increases the frequency of emoji insertions.
  * `Hold My Bug: Stop Inserting Emojis`: Pauses all emoji and bug insertion activity.

### Useless Commands

These commands exist solely to make your life harder in the most entertaining way possible.

  * `Hold My Bug: Activate Useless Mode`: Inserts a random, useless message or emoji into your code, pretending to be helpful.
  * `Hold My Bug: Introduce a Random Typo`: Replaces a single character in your code with a random character, creating a bug that is both small and incredibly frustrating to find.
  * `Hold My Bug: Add a Sarcastic Comment`: Inserts a snarky, unhelpful comment at a random location, questioning your life choices and coding abilities.
